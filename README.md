 3. Notebooks 
The notebooks below contain the data analysis and ML code used for this project. Due to the intensive computing requirements for running the neural networks, the ML models were broken down into separate notebooks so they could be run in parallel in a high performance cloud computing environment. 
    - [Car Depreciation](https://github.com/sethorus30/Car_depreciation-analysis/blob/main/Capstone_machine_learning-depreciation_per_year_compounded.ipynb) Trying to figure out what was the main cause for the cars' compunded depreciation, which features played a bigger role in a car retaining their value over an extended period of time. This notebook is the final draft for the car depreciation notebooks.
  -   [Car Depreciation Analysis](https://github.com/sethorus30/Car_depreciation-analysis/blob/main/Car_Depreciation%26Analysis.ipynb) draft where I was testing out different data visualization techniques to help with analysis. 
  -   [Car Depreciation Analysis](https://github.com/sethorus30/Car_depreciation-analysis/blob/main/Car_depreciation%26analysis.ipynb) draft where of the car depreciation notebook where the main focus was on improving the binning as well as other methods to present the data more efficiently.
